##  Introduction
This project explores the **Wine Dataset** from `sklearn.datasets`, using **six supervised machine learning classification models**:
The goal is to train, evaluate, and compare the models using the same dataset, to understand which model performs best and why.

- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Tree  
- Random Forest  
- k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- Naive Bayes  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
